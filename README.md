# Travel-Tide
Customer segmentation of a Travel Agency "Travel Tide"

The Objective of Customer Segmentation
TravelTide, a travel booking platform, is aiming for better customer engagement. The marketing team has crafted five potential perks to enhance the customer experience as follows:

1. Free hotel meals
2. Free checked bags
3. No cancellation fees
4. Exclusive discounts
5. One-night free hotel with a flight

My main goal with this analysis is to identify different customer segments, each with their own preferences for particular perks based on their past behaviour. This first step is crucial in creating a personalized rewards program. However, it’s important to note that the program’s success will only be determined once these appealing perks are offered to our customers and their reactions are carefully observed and analyzed.

## Step 1: Cohort Definition
My first task is selecting the right group of customers for analysis. To ensure the reliability of our segmentation analysis, we consider the time customers have spent interacting with the platform.

Following guidance from the Marketing Team, our defined cohort consists of users who engaged with the platform after the New Year holiday, starting from January 4, 2023 and participated in more than seven browsing sessions during this period. This approach provides a substantial behavioural dataset, excluding recent users with limited interactions.
